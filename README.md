ANAMIA-Egocenter
================

This archive contains the flash applet ANAMIA Egocenter by ANAMIA project in collaboration with Eranos (Paris). 

ANAMIA Egocenter allows users to draw an egocentered network of their friends, relations, internet contacts and acquaintances. It is intended to be embedded in a computer-based survey.

----

To use the applet, either open the index-EN.html (English version) or the index-FR.html (French version) file in your browser.

To change the texts in the applet (name generator, nodes tags, tie tags), refer to the _xml/article_reseau_en.xml and _xml/article_reseau_fr.xml files.

The applet saves the user-drawn egocentered networks in jpg and xml formats. In order to do so, you will need to modify the $file variable in the savejpg.php and savexml.php files.
